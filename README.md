# Big Company - Currency Converter 

The corresponding application is a Currecny Converter UI, which retrieves live currencies and exchange rates from the CurrencyLayer API, and provides a quick standard conversion, as well as an specific conversion for Big Company employees. 

This application is built using the ReactJS and TailwindCSS web development frameworks. Steps have been made towards making the entire application responsive to varying screen sizes, as well and providing an error route if the conversion request was unsuccessfull.

It is acknowledged that bugs still remain in the application, however, due to time constraints and other commitments, this version is deemed adequete for now, and will be revisted when I have finished my studies.
